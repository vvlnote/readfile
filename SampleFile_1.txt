There's a reason that royal watchers often refer to the British royal family as the world's longest-running soap opera. It's a story filled with glamorous people, power struggles, scandals, and, sometimes, tragedy.

The most recent round of press has focused on a rumored rift between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and Prince William and Kate Middleton. There's always gossip when it comes to the royals, but reports really heated up after it was announced that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would be making their official home in Windsor outside of London proper, away from Kensington Palace where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge live with their three children.

Initial reports focused on a problem between the duchesses, which multiple royal insiders have since debunked. Now, sources are claiming the tension is really between the brothersâ€”with a heartbreaking reason at the core. A story from the Sun's royal reporter Emily Andrews posits that Harry's extreme protectiveness of Markle is causing some of the problems.
